   PLUGIN USAGE
==================

installation:
make
make install

echo /all | nc 127.0.0.1 2006
 or
telnet 127.0.0.1 2006 (and type /all then enter)
 or
wget http://localhost:2006/all -qO -
 or
curl http://localhost:2006/all

Or in a web browser: http://localhost:2006/all

The output shows the links of the node, its neighbors, the topology
table, HNA (Host and Network Association) and MID (Multiple Interface
Declaration) tables and the actual routing table.

So what commands does the txtinfo plugin accept?

    * Config: "/config" -> send_what=SIW_CONFIG
    * Gateways: "/gateway" -> send_what=SIW_GATEWAY
    * HNA: "/hna" -> send_what=SIW_HNA
    * Interfaces: "/interface" -> send_what=SIW_INTERFACE
    * Links: "/link" -> send_what=SIW_LINK
    * MID: "/mid" -> send_what=SIW_MID
    * Neighbors: "/neigh" -> send_what=SIW_NEIGH
    * Routes: "/route" -> send_what=SIW_ROUTE
    * Topology: "/topo" -> send_what=SIW_TOPO
    * 2-hop neighbors: "/2hop" -> send_what=SIW_2HOP
    * Version: "/ver" -> send_what=version of olsrd
    * (Smart) Gateway Information: "/sgw" -> send_what=information on all active (smart) gateways

This is the same as the "/neigh" and "/link" commands combined:

    * "/neighbours" -> send_what = SIW_NEIGHLINK -> neighbours and links

Then there is "/all" which returns all of the most commonly used
commands above (but not every command above). "/all" is the same as
"/links/neigh/topo/hna/mid/routes".

   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

The plugin accepts two parameters: "port" and "accept". There are no
futher parameters.  Here's an example configuration for UNIX systems
(for Windows, change the plugin to end in .dll):

LoadPlugin "olsrd_txtinfo.so.0.1"
{
    # The port number on which the plugin will be listening
    # PlParam     "port"               "2006"

    # You can set an "accept" IP address that is allowed to connect to
    # the plugin. If no address is specified, then localhost (127.0.0.1)
    # is allowed by default.  Only the last parameter specified will be used,
    # others will be ignored.
    # Use 0.0.0.0 to accept all connections
    # PlParam     "accept"             "127.0.0.1"

    # You can set a "listen" IP address that is used to determine the interface
    # on which the plugin will be listening. If no address is specified, then
    # the plugin will listen on all interfaes. Only the last parameter specified
    # will be used, others will be ignored.
    # PlParam     "listen"             "0.0.0.0"

    # Set to true to only listen on IPv6 addresses when running in IPv6 mode.
    # PlParam     "ipv6only"           "false"
}
